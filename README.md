# MCM_2018
Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2018


In the rapidly globalizing world that we live in, many multinational companies are looking to expand their operations into various countries worldwide.
As a result, our aim of this project is to identify which combination of languages should the employees in these companies be able to speak in order to communicate with the greatest number of potential customers.
Additionally, we will also aim to identify the countries/cities where these companies should open new offices in.
